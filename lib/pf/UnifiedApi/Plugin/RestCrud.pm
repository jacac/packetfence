=head2 register_action

my $new_route = $route->register_action({
    method => 'GET',
    action => 'action',
    controller => 'Controller',
    path   => '/action_path',
    name   => 'name',
});

The minimum needed

my $new_route = $route->register_action({
    method => 'GET',
    action => 'action',
});

Is the same as

my $new_route = $route->register_action({
    method => 'GET',
    action => 'action',
    path   => '/action',
    name   => 'action',
});

If no controller is defined then will use the parent route controller

=cut

sub register_action {
    my ($route, $args) = @_;
    my $method = $args->{method};
    if (!defined $method || !exists $ALLOWED_METHODS{$method}) {
        die "invalid method given ". ($method // "undef" );
    }

    my $action = $args->{action};
    if (!defined $action) {
        die "no action is defined"
    }

    my $path = $args->{path} // "/$action";
    my $controller = $args->{controller};
    my $name = $args->{name} // $action;
    return
      $route->any([$method] => $path)
            ->to( action => $action, ( defined $controller ? ( controller => $controller ) : () ))
            ->name( $route->name . ".$name" );
}
